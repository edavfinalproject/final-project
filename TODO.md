### Notes
- Is population growth the biggest threat to sustainable energy consumption?
- Visualize populaiton growth vs energy growth of various countries
    - GDP, happinesss/quality of life score
- Hypothesis: populaiton growth rates and populaiton size have large variation in per capita energy consumption between countries indicating there are other stronger factors to focus on besides population growth as the problem.
- Could also compare states within the US.
- What is the correlation between per capita energy use and populaiton growth?
